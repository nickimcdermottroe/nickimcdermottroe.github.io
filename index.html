                <p>Working with a wide range of stakeholders, both internal and external to the BBC, I led the design of ‚ÄúReactive Reactions‚Äù, a brand new way for children to participate on the CBBC website. Facilitating user testing and co-creation sessions with children for the very first time, I embraced the opportunities for personal development that this project provided.</p>
                <p>As part of the wider product strategy we were tasked with giving children a fun and easy way to voice their thoughts. In particular - empowering them to participate on the CBBC website. Working closely with an external agency, we ideated and produced a number of different routes to tackle this brief.</p>
                <p>The idea that we chose ‚Äì emojis that grow to fill the screen ‚Äì mirrored the way children extend LOL into LOLOLOLOL when typing. I‚Äôd identified this behaviour from the comments left on the CBBC website, and it was this key piece of data that informed this choice.</p>
                <p>The range of emojis that we designed for inclusion was vast. To narrow this down this we embarked upon user testing and co-creation sessions. I facilitated these sessions, embracing the challenge of testing with children for the very first time. These sessions were hugely rewarding, requiring a very different approach to testing with adults.</p>
                <p>During these sessions we established that whilst some of our emojis were unrecognisable, our solution worked. Better still, children found it delightful and fun.</p>
                <p>The Reactive Reactions feature went live in July 2018 after 14 months of hard work. I contributed much of what I learned throughout the project to a GEL article entitled ‚ÄúHow to use reactions in your content‚Äù. The emojis have appeared in TV ads and marketing materials for CBBC Buzz and the CBBC Summer Social event.</p>

                <p>Spending a year redesigning the commenting system for the CBBC website, I had to demonstrate great resilience to stay positive and keep on pushing forward. The project was complicated, involving a wider range of stakeholders than I‚Äôd ever encountered before, and the pace was so slow that it was hard to keep momentum. But by staying focused I learned a great deal about communication and the ethical responsibilities of being a designer in children‚Äôs.</p>
                <p>We craft bespoke experiences, designed specifically for kids in the children‚Äôs team, but the comments are an exception. When a child comments on a CBBC post, they are presented with the same experience that an adult receives on the BBC website. I worked with the legal, audience platform and UX writing teams to redesign this experience.</p>
                <p>I began by breaking the problem down into 2 parts, starting by analysing the anatomy of a comment before considering how we might apply a children‚Äôs layer to the experience. This approach allowed me to tackle the problem in manageable chunks and allowed me to consider the work in a wider BBC context, seeing a range of applications for the improvements I was proposing.</p>
                <p>Having designed a range of new features and improvements, I took on the unprecedented challenge of testing with 100 children in order to gauge the appetite as well as the usability of our new features.</p>
                <p>An unforeseen insight from this testing was that a significant amount of the children we tested with were worried about being bullied in the comments section of a website. Most had experienced this and it strongly coloured their opinions on our new features. Following this insight I focused on the reporting experience, feeling an ethical responsibility to ensure that a child could flag a comment that upset them more easily than ever.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project I kept stakeholders from across the business informed of our plans and our progress and managed this project along with the Reactive Reactions work over a sustained period.</p>
                <p>Whilst the redesigned commenting experience for children is still under development, I‚Äôve recently learned that the work on reporting a comment for children has formed the basis for the platform team‚Äôs work on comments for the wider BBC.</p>

                <p>Recently, myself and another UX designer built a case for removing ‚Äòplayback in the background‚Äô from iPlayer - an outdated feature that many designers had tried to remove before. What made it especially difficult, was that removing it would actually decrease one of iPlayer‚Äôs key metrics: time spent. As a product with a strict roadmap, achieving this change was to be an immense challenge.</p>
                <p>In order to influence the product‚Äôs decision to remove it, I knew that the feature needed to be looked at from all angles (impact on metrics, technical effort, user experience) and for the case to be bulletproof.  I completed market analysis and found no evidence of this feature on competitor products. This, coupled with quotes from user research and a heuristic analysis, suggested that this feature provided no value to the user.</p>
                <p>I also spoke with development teams who reported that maintaining ‚Äòplayback in the background‚Äô doubled their workload. Testers vouched that the performance of the app was also affected by this feature.</p>
                <p>The key to influencing the decision to remove this feature was bringing all of this evidence together and presenting it to all 20 stakeholders in a single meeting. I scheduled this meeting two months in advance to ensure the attendance of key decision makers. This was a strategic decision designed to create a forum for stakeholders to hold a productive debate and most importantly make a decision there and then.</p>
                <p>The influence I had was in collating opinions from across the business, creating a consensus that this feature was outdated and should be removed from iPlayer.</p>
                <p>In January 2019, this feature was removed from iPlayer as a direct result of our work. </p>
