                <p>Working with a wide range of stakeholders, both internal and external to the BBC, I led the design of “Reactive Reactions”, a brand new way for children to participate on the CBBC website. Facilitating user testing and co-creation sessions with children for the very first time, I embraced the opportunities for personal development that this project provided.</p>
                <p>As part of the wider product strategy we were tasked with giving children a fun and easy way to voice their thoughts. In particular - empowering them to participate on the CBBC website. Working closely with an external agency, we ideated and produced a number of different routes to tackle this brief.</p>
                <p>The idea that we chose – emojis that grow to fill the screen – mirrored the way children extend LOL into LOLOLOLOL when typing. I’d identified this behaviour from the comments left on the CBBC website, and it was this key piece of data that informed this choice.</p>
                <p>The range of emojis that we designed for inclusion was vast. To narrow this down this we embarked upon user testing and co-creation sessions. I facilitated these sessions, embracing the challenge of testing with children for the very first time. These sessions were hugely rewarding, requiring a very different approach to testing with adults.</p>
                <p>During these sessions we established that whilst some of our emojis were unrecognisable, our solution worked. Better still, children found it delightful and fun.</p>
                <p>The Reactive Reactions feature went live in July 2018 after 14 months of hard work. I contributed much of what I learned throughout the project to a GEL article entitled “How to use reactions in your content”. The emojis have appeared in TV ads and marketing materials for CBBC Buzz and the CBBC Summer Social event.</p>

                <p>Spending a year redesigning the commenting system for the CBBC website, I had to demonstrate great resilience to stay positive and keep on pushing forward. The project was complicated, involving a wider range of stakeholders than I’d ever encountered before, and the pace was so slow that it was hard to keep momentum. But by staying focused I learned a great deal about communication and the ethical responsibilities of being a designer in children’s.</p>
                <p>We craft bespoke experiences, designed specifically for kids in the children’s team, but the comments are an exception. When a child comments on a CBBC post, they are presented with the same experience that an adult receives on the BBC website. I worked with the legal, audience platform and UX writing teams to redesign this experience.</p>
                <p>I began by breaking the problem down into 2 parts, starting by analysing the anatomy of a comment before considering how we might apply a children’s layer to the experience. This approach allowed me to tackle the problem in manageable chunks and allowed me to consider the work in a wider BBC context, seeing a range of applications for the improvements I was proposing.</p>
                <p>Having designed a range of new features and improvements, I took on the unprecedented challenge of testing with 100 children in order to gauge the appetite as well as the usability of our new features.</p>
                <p>An unforeseen insight from this testing was that a significant amount of the children we tested with were worried about being bullied in the comments section of a website. Most had experienced this and it strongly coloured their opinions on our new features. Following this insight I focused on the reporting experience, feeling an ethical responsibility to ensure that a child could flag a comment that upset them more easily than ever.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project I kept stakeholders from across the business informed of our plans and our progress and managed this project along with the Reactive Reactions work over a sustained period.</p>
                <p>Whilst the redesigned commenting experience for children is still under development, I’ve recently learned that the work on reporting a comment for children has formed the basis for the platform team’s work on comments for the wider BBC.</p>

                <p>Joining a new team and getting up to speed with a huge piece of work, already in progress, felt like a daunting enough task as it was. But with the World Cup looming, a deadline just three weeks away and a host of stakeholders to impress (that I’d yet to even meet!) redesigning the live experience for sport fans on TV was a challenge like no other.</p>
                <p>With an objective to “make the BBC Sport TV app <em>the</em> destination for Live Sport” defined in early 2018, I joined the Interactive TV team in May with the project mid way through the ideation phase. I had to immerse myself in the research behind the project, understand the problem and begin ideating immediately. I threw myself into this process and produced a vast amount of design work in a short time, exploring the limits of what the live experience on TV could be. This even included a self initiated visit to the live production studio to understand how the editorial team organise live content.</p>
                <p>With our deadline fast approaching, our product team made the decision to release an MVP. Although frustrating, as my work had been warmly received, I took a pragmatic approach, stripping the work back to the elements that provided the most value to our users.</p>
                <p>Throughout the process, sharing my work with one particular stakeholder proved difficult and required flexibility on my part. I had to negotiate a language barrier, a frustrating focus on placeholder content and a misunderstanding of terminology. But by adapting the presentation of my design work – reducing it to wireframes and defining terminology more clearly – I was able to eschew these problems and forge a strong and productive relationship.</p>
                <p>Following agreement from stakeholders I pushed the project forward into user testing, writing the discussion guide and facilitating several of the sessions. I joined a development crew and we worked as a multi disciplinary team to launch in time for the World Cup.</p>
                <p>My work on this project continues , as I learn and iterate on the experience in pursuit of our product objective.</p>
